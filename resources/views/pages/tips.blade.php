renting a flat in Berlin

There are many sites to choose from to rent a short term apartment but which are the best ?

Airbnb

Definately worth a look as they have a large selection of apartments all over Berlin and are reasonably priced. they have an advantage over some of the other
holiday let sites in that they have a day/week/monthly rate which means you will be getting a significant discount on if your looking to book longer than a few 
days.

Downsides:

You never quite know what your getting, the internet may be slow

Homestay

Has a limited selection of apartments and doesn't offer a weekly or monthyl discount so you'll end up paying alot more if looking to book long term, but short term says 
this is worth a look.

Homeaway

CaseaBerlino

An alternative estate agents run by italians in Berlin, we booked our first apartment through them and it was a very simple easy process.

They have a decent selection of apartments in Berlin and some extremely reasonably priced apartments (starting from around 600 euros ). Keep in mind that if 
there is 2 of you 120 will be added onto the rental price shown but they can still work out cheaper than booking through an alternative such as airbnb and 
most of the flats are a bit nicer than airbnb apartments.

Decent internet.
